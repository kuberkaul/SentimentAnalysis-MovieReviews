how on earth  or anywhere else  did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm  and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .

the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
arguably the best script that besson has written in years .

less dizzying than just dizzy  the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .

kicks off with an inauspicious premise  mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race .

this time  the hype is quieter  and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first  it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
 . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance

when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises  ' we nod in agreement . 
the film is full of charm . 
like its title character  this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and  also like its hero  it remains brightly optimistic  coming through in the end .

shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had  godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
a simple  but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
neither quite a comedy nor a romance  more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors  it is worth searching out . 
weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .

a worthy idea  but the uninspired scripts  acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly  watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea  shed an errant tear . 
like the rugrats movies  the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series  but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .

morton is  as usual  brilliant . 
warmed-over hash . 
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more .

skillful as he is  mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
this film seems thirsty for reflection  itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
bad and baffling from the get-go . 
the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic .

many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside  and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
informative  intriguing  observant  often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch  elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
elling  portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen  is a truly singular character  one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
starts slowly  but adrien brody ?in the title role ?helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
the question hanging over the time machine is not  as the main character suggests  'what if ? ' but rather  'how can you charge money for this ? '
broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all  and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good  but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third卐motionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
the documentary does little  apart from raising the topic  to further stoke the conversation . 
while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught  there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
it's plotless  shapeless -- and yet  it must be admitted  not entirely humorless . indeed  the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
stinks from start to finish  like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting  but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher  and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced  inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words  possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
the film can depress you about life itself . 
a slight and obvious effort  even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits  age-wise . 
for a film about action  ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever  bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out  cannot overcome blah characters . 
real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
at times  it actually hurts to watch . 
maelstrom is strange and compelling  engrossing and different  a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture  ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
it puts washington  as honest working man john q . archibald  on a pedestal  then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart   in the bedroom   moretti's film makes its own  quieter observations
captures all the longing  anguish and ache  the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing  raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
a strong script  powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman  who is not only a pianist  but a good human being . 
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay  which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien  with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich�s the filmmakers could dredge up . 
to work  love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
i liked it because it was so endlessly  grotesquely  inventive . 
an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
it was filled with shootings  beatings  and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 
don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
good performances and a realistic  non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
more romantic  more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and  of course  special effect . 
combines sharp comedy  old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics  and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * *  but also about dealing with regret and  ultimately  finding redemption . 
avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
go for la salle's performance  and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
a relentless  bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please  and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses  nor their characters  deserve . 
this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
no  it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
it's not a bad plot ; but  unfortunately  the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other  just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs  it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy  an inkling of genuine wit  and anything resembling acting . 
the good is very  very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
like all abstract art  the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way  and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
insomnia is involving . still  i thought it could have been more . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
skins has a desolate air  but eyre  a native american raised by white parents  manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
this is one of polanski's best films . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
 . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
from the opening strains of the average white band's  pick up the pieces   you can feel the love . 
the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
hey everybody  wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
what's next ? rob schneider  dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless  it still seems endless . 
circuit queens won't learn a thing  they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 
with minimal imagination  you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
though filmed partly in canada  paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly  scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
despite the 2-d animation  the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
 . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i've seen in quite a long time . 
a grittily beautiful film that looks  sounds  and feels more like an extended  open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark  brooding and slow  and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction  and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow  selfish  greedy characters . 
an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
this thing is just garbage . 
[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons  in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
the far future may be awesome to consider  but from period detail to matters of the heart  this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
odd and weird . 
devolves into the derivative  leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
after a while  hoffman's quirks and mannerisms  particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck  it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
[f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative  the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch  even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
the exploitative  clumsily staged violence overshadows everything  including most of the actors . 
well before it's over  beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching  but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat  as the stalker doesn't do much stalking  and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
lazy filmmaking  with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that  as in real life  we're never sure how things will work out . 
beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
the asylum material is gripping  as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious  who cares ? 
brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and  perhaps  give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise  but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
slight but enjoyable documentary . 
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler  there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
unfortunately  kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american  a decision that plucks  the four feathers  bare . 
a real snooze . 
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality  it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
it's immensely ambitious  different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
in adobo  ethnicity is not just the spice  but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology  pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak  as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
'barbershop  is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage  be careful what you wish for  is given a full workout . 
the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma  but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest  most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic  but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
despite its flaws  crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress  even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
like kubrick  soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
affable if not timeless  like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
one of those energetic surprises  an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening  or the part where something's happening  but it's stupid . 
the humor is forced and heavy-handed  and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness  but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . 
in its understanding  often funny way  it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
in the real world  an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r�sum� loaded with credits like  girl in bar #3 .  
daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all  especially those who aren't aware of  or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
in some ways  lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much  much better . 
at first  the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious  but as the film goes on  the joke wears thin . 
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither  and fails at both endeavors . 
not for everyone  but for those with whom it will connect  it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it  and  of course  feeling guilty for it . . . . then  miracle of miracles  the movie does a flip-flop . 
seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior  as happiness was . . . hence  storytelling is far more appealing . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game  juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre  and a personal low for everyone involved . 
you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
the editing is chaotic  the photography grainy and badly focused  the writing unintentionally hilarious  the direction unfocused  the performances as wooden . 
 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects  and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing  considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
this is no  waterboy !  
the 3-d vistas from orbit  with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe  are stanzas of breathtaking  awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud  too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
  13 conversations  holds its goodwill close  but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up  but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
 . . . an interesting slice of history . 
often messy and frustrating  but very pleasing at its best moments  it's very much like life itself . 
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again  even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new  at least it looks pretty . 
 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .

to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
this is a throwaway  junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair .

  abandon  will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
just another disjointed  fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .

in its own floundering way  it gets to you . just like igby . 
there's enough science to make it count as educational  and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
if the movie were all comedy  it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects  but not a willingness . 
an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
i can't begin to tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made  showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon  anyway .

always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
having had the good sense to cast actors who are  generally speaking  adored by the movie-going public  khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
 . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a  what was it all for ?  feeling to it  but like the 1920's  the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
opening with some contrived banter  cliches and some loose ends  the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here  once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that  in many other hands would be completely forgettable .

this sensitive  smart  savvy  compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .

thoroughly awful . 
after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here  it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick  contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical  small and decadent for the malls . 
a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
its story about a young chinese woman  ah na  who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title  many can aspire but none can equal .

[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size  and it ain't pretty . 
sparse but oddly compelling . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate  surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
 . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs ?sometimes a chuckle  sometimes a guffaw and  to my great pleasure  the occasional belly laugh . 
as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is  there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director  frank novak  that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
 at its best  it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst  it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
just one bad idea after another . 
likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
like most of jaglom's films  some of it is honestly affecting  but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself  stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing  and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt  it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see  simone   and consider a dvd rental instead . 
the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written  underrehearsed  arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another  making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops  but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
an old-fashioned scary movie  one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
the movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture  and comes across as darkly funny  energetic  and surprisingly gentle . 
none of this sounds promising and  indeed  the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
there is a fabric of complex ideas here  and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
the script is smart  not cloying . 
a deceivingly simple film  one that grows in power in retrospect . 
the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
a solidly entertaining little film . 
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone  anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure  a stalker thriller  and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
even the digressions are funny . 
a passable romantic comedy  in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy  which makes its message resonate . 
in xxx  diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners  and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep . 
the movie strains to stay on the light  comic side of the issue  despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and  potentially  of life itself . 
tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
 . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny  thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking )  a solid cast  and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
the film contains no good jokes  no good scenes  barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
kitschy  flashy  overlong soap opera . 
you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
reassuring  retro uplifter . 
an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
it doesn't make for great cinema  but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you  the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
fun  flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .

atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
philosophically  intellectually and logistically a mess . 
a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
while the script starts promisingly  it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute  it's full of throwaway one-liners  not-quite jokes  and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
this is mostly well-constructed fluff  which is all it seems intended to be . 
it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film  but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction  a friday night diversion  an excuse to eat popcorn .

a vile  incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '

the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .

a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and  hence  more chillingly effective . 
not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works  but coppola  along with his sister  sofia  is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes  wendigo  larry fessenden's spooky new thriller  is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .

serious and thoughtful . 
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
the movie is a blast of educational energy  as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
expect the same-old  lame-old slasher nonsense  just with different scenery . 
the most horrific movie experience i've had since  can't stop the music .  it may as well be called  jar-jar binks : the movie .  it's that painful . 
takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
this is a dark  gritty  sometimes funny little gem . 
claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters  veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect  but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded  as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich�s from start to finish  and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience  but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .

as the two leads  lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness  raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .

here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here  but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .

it helps that the central performers are experienced actors  and that they know their roles so well . 
exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven?[the film] addresses in a fascinating  intelligent manner the intermingling of race  politics and local commerce .

involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
none of this is very original  and it isn't particularly funny . 
if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from  then look no further  because here it is .

too simple for its own good . 
smith examines the intimate  unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .

between bursts of automatic gunfire  the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri  you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally  i'd rather watch them on the animal planet .

big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
unpretentious  charming  quirky  original
what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ?

this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
i've never bought from telemarketers  but i bought this movie . 
the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing  and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not  nor will he be  back . 
the storytelling may be ordinary  but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
in its own way  joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis bu�uel film without the latter's attendant intelligence  poetry  passion  and genius . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever  it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .

viewers of  the ring  are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating  though  even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors . 
vera has created a provocative  absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 
norton is magnetic as graham . 
rarely do films come along that are as intelligent  exuberant  and moving as monsoon wedding . 
what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
  . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play .  
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour  i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
 . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
occasionally funny and consistently odd  and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool  but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action  but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and  what's worse  routine . 
the performances are so leaden  michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
exactly what its title implies : lusty  boisterous and utterly charming . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video  giving the whole thing a dirty  tasteless feel . 
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh  ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
the movie  directed by mick jackson  leaves no cliche unturned  from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
a simpler  leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all  being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
it tells more than it shows . 
a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless  witless  and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
predictably melodramatic . 
worthy of the gong . 
if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying  its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
been there  done that  liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
fast and funny  an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
barney has created a tour de force that is weird  wacky and wonderful . 
it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may  for whatever reason  be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie  but more often just feels generic  derivative and done to death . 
serviceable at best  slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
awesome work : ineffable  elusive  yet inexplicably powerful
defies logic  the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american  a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
holy mad maniac in a mask  splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
she's as rude and profane as ever  always hilarious and  most of the time  absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
it's not without its pleasures  but i'll stick with the tune . 
even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment  spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
by the standards of knucklehead swill  the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
it understands  in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy  kinky fun . 
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders  chan wades through putrid writing  direction and timing with a smile that says  'if i stay positive  maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures  drunken master . '
at every opportunity to do something clever  the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex  dramatically satisfying heroine
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
consistently clever and suspenseful . 
it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world  a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
a chiller resolutely without chills . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was  as my friend david cross would call it  'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
a hip ride into hyper-time  clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time .

a gripping drama . 
excessive  profane  packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay  in pops nathan lane . 
it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
a solid  spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
divertingly ridiculous  headbangingly noisy . 
kurys never shows why  of all the period's volatile romantic lives  sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff� and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
enjoyably dumb  sweet  and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky  steal a glimpse . 
a profoundly stupid affair  populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
slack and uninspired  and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth .

directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter  but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
initially gripping  eventually cloying pow drama . 
sometimes charming  sometimes infuriating  this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond  but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with  xxx  is that its own action isn't very effective . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff  demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent  well-made b movie is long gone . 
it is definitely worth seeing . 
too much of nemesis has a tired  talky feel . 
any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
see it now  before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd  intriguing wrinkles . 
it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
this one is certainly well-meaning  but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
there is very little dread or apprehension  and though i like the creepy ideas  they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
a slight but sweet film . 
a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe  and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace  letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and  occasionally  anger . 
feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful  half-naked women . 
fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
howard and his co-stars all give committed performances  but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
behind the glitz  hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
comes across as a relic from a bygone era  and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching  as will the fight scenes . 
although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
critics need a good laugh  too  and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous  sickening  sidesplitting goods in steaming  visceral heaps . 
it's hard to say who might enjoy this  are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic  and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
cherry orchard is badly edited  often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
it's something of the ultimate scorsese film  with all the stomach-turning violence  colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting  wooden performances  ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
doesn't add up to much . 
the film brilliantly shines on all the characters  as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
thanks to ice cube  benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again  and while that is a cliche  nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity  profanity and violence  labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
debut effort by  project greenlight  winner is sappy and amateurish . 
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
buy is an accomplished actress  and this is a big  juicy role . 
 . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected  everything else about the film tanks . 
van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world . 
fubar is very funny  but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
for devotees of french cinema  safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
from both a great and a terrible story  mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family  forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting  less symmetrical  less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
do not see this film . 
a stylish thriller . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
like mike is a harmlessly na飗e slice of b-ball fantasy  fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
a riveting profile of law enforcement  and a visceral  nasty journey into an urban hades . 
so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle  there isn't much there here . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie  and a sappy  preachy one at that . 
a smart  witty follow-up . 
possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people  relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
leaves you with a knot in your stomach  its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose  lackadaisical charm . 
a captivating new film . 
the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
plays like john le carr� with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody  bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending  which is just the point . 
visually striking and viscerally repellent . 
rife with the rueful  wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect  it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso  sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast  and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie  no matter who runs them . 
it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
a feature-length  r-rated  road-trip version of mama's family . 
it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
?uma pena que  mais tarde  o pr髉rio filme abandone o tom de par骴ia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich阺 que havia satirizado . 
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world  then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly  comedy-deficient  b-movie rush job . . . 
too clever by about nine-tenths . 
a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . 
o 趌timo suspeito ganha for鏰 ao tamb閙 funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly  analyze that really isn't all that bad . 
a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza  with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom ?handguns  bmws and seaside chateaus . 
cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director  it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
one thing's for sure�if george romero had directed this movie  it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud  whose charm  cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is  collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
there are cheesy backdrops  ridiculous action sequences  and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly  very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
very special effects  brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in  stuart little 2  : there's just no story  folks . 
certainly beautiful to look at  but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
not only is undercover brother as funny  if not more so  than both austin powers films  but it's also one of the smarter  savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
watching e . t now  in an era dominated by cold  loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas  one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees  or even himself  will not be for much longer . 
the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict  just like the movie does
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
visually breathtaking  viscerally exciting  and dramatically moving  it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan  because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
a work of intricate elegance  literary lyricism and profound common sense . 
the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships  including that between the son and his wife  and the wife and the father  and between the two brothers  with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture  and i mean that as a compliment . 
seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
a comedy that is warm  inviting  and surprising . 
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10  but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's  let alone some savvy street activism . 
the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place  that time and that sport . 
a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
in a movie full of surprises  the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy  both gentle and biting . 
often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness  but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and  in turn  his self-inflicted retaliation . 
while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium  yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
an odd  haphazard  and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
the entire movie is about a boring  sad man being boring and sad . 
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers  the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy  vulgar is  truly and thankfully  a one-of-a-kind work . 
what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed  natural-seeming actors . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
never lets go your emotions  taking them to surprising highs  sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous  passionate  and at times uncommonly moving . 
what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
think of it as gidget  only with muscles and a lot more smarts  but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards  more power to it . 
what could have easily become a cold  calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking . 
it's a powerful though flawed movie  guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
one of the finest  most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 
this is a finely written  superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
vibrantly colored and beautifully designed  metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
 . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character  an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
no worse a film than breaking out  and breaking out was utterly charming . 
kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
even as lame horror flicks go  this is lame . 
a lovely film . . . elegant  witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge  [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly  clinical lab report . 
having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel  it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization  haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
watching  ending  is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario  and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
a combination of standard  stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable  shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes  southern california locations and star power . 
despite engaging offbeat touches  knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky  but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit . 
a static and sugary little half-hour  after-school special about interfaith understanding  stretched out to 90 minutes . 
you wouldn't want to live waydowntown  but it is a hilarious place to visit . 
boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie  rose's film  true to its source material  provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer . 
i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
secret ballot is a funny  puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing  while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack  or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
made for teens and reviewed as such  this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation  with no great love for the original . 
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video  then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
it's slow -- very  very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
as the princess  sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . ben kingsley is truly funny  playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl  that's all . 
it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect  and is engrossing and moving in its own right . 
 . . . a confusing drudgery . 
either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
it's inoffensive  cheerful  built to inspire the young people  set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery  it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
[breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say  the '60s . 
aside from minor tinkering  this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994  except that it looks even better . 
like the best 60 minutes expos? the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually  but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime  and the fanatical excess built into it . 
a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
it looks good  but it is essentially empty . 
movie fans  get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation  the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again  and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
unfortunately  carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
thanks to a small star with big heart  this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
an unforgettable look at morality  family  and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul  even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
 . . . a rather bland affair . 
idiotic and ugly . 
a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian . . . life . 
an often unfunny romp . 
the characters  cast in impossibly contrived situations  are totally estranged from reality . 
in addition to the overcooked  ham-fisted direction  which has all the actors reaching for the back row  the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative  but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big  dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
bisset delivers a game performance  but she is unable to save the movie . 
should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie  but it's so poorly made  on all levels  that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
in exactly 89 minutes  most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo  formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously  folks  it doesn't work . 
playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance  at that ) . 
the gags  and the script  are a mixed bag . 
steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
in the era of the sopranos  it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
more busy than exciting  more frantic than involving  more chaotic than entertaining . 
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
with little visible talent and no energy  colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
cusack's just brilliant in this . 
 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse  turning into a black hole of dullness  from which no interesting concept can escape . 
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre  with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum  i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
the film has [its] moments  but they are few and far between . 
this delicately observed story  deeply felt and masterfully stylized  is a triumph for its maverick director . 
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue  heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment  and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention  than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
there isn't nearly enough fun here  despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
the performances are remarkable . 
a tough go  but leigh's depth and rigor  and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness  offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
the action here is unusually tame  the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest  and the plot offers few surprises . 
simplistic  silly and tedious . 
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action  all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
[westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date  but when it comes out on video  it's well worth a rental . 
karmen moves like rhythm itself  her lips chanting to the beat  her long  braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
enigma is well-made  but it's just too dry and too placid . 
easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears  and a g rating )  with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
it's a count for our times . 
the touch is generally light enough and the performances  for the most part  credible . 
finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts  waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
a canny  derivative  wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
in the end  the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived  as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
 . . . the same tired old gags  modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
the criticism never rises above easy  cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix  i have just one word for you -?decasia
maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements . 
the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
i'm sure if you're a hartley fan  you might enjoy yourself . . . me  i didn't care for it . 
grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
[a] satisfying niblet . 
provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh  groan and hiss at . 
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
liman  of swingers and go  makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long  low-heat chase  interrupted by a middling car chase . 
despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even  at times  preposterous ) turns  love is just too  too precious in the end . 
it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
funny  sexy  devastating and incurably romantic . 
offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . 
i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes  pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
a smart and funny  albeit sometimes superficial  cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . 
a vivid cinematic portrait . 
birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in  15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french  do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
it's mildly amusing  but i certainly can't recommend it . 
an empty exercise  a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
i've seen some bad singer-turned actors  but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
allegiance to chekhov  which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard  is a particularly vexing handicap . 
it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
 . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy  the troopers will entertain with their gross outs  bawdy comedy and head games . 
stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup  while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut  mad cows . 
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive  overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling  some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
in his role of observer of the scene  lawrence sounds whiny and defensive  as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
half submarine flick  half ghost story  all in one criminally neglected film
the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent  stylish moviemaking . 
just consider what new best friend does not have  beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
trapped won't score points for political correctness  but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
it's a setup so easy it borders on facile  but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
though it's not very well shot or composed or edited  the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal  the film shatters you in waves . 
tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
the ending does leave you unfulfilled  but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
if the tuxedo actually were a suit  it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
it's a nicely detailed world of pawns  bishops and kings  of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
 . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny )  profound without ever being self-important  warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate  if somewhat flawed  treatment . 
a mess  but it's a sincere mess . 
a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses  it's also full of sharp  smart satire . 
passions  obsessions  and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits  lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
there's something deeply creepy about never again  a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple � he's understated and sardonic  she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
here  common sense flies out the window  along with the hail of bullets  none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
this documentary is a dazzling  remarkably unpretentious reminder of what [evans] had  lost  and got back . 
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads  etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
not only unfunny  but downright repellent . 
mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium  and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
a much better documentary -- more revealing  more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
it's clear why deuces wild  which was shot two years ago  has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles  it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat  but as a character he's dry  dry  dry . 
cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad  but more like  'i once had a nightmare like this  and it's now coming true' bad . 
has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue  the yale grad who previously gave us  the skulls  and last year's  rollerball .  enough said  except : film overboard ! 
if you like quirky  odd movies and/or the ironic  here's a fun one . 
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario  and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .

true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff  ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
what an embarrassment . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
a fantastic premise anchors this movie  but what it needs is either a more rigid  blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format  or a more straightforward  dramatic treatment  with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
with miscast leads  banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax  killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating  genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills  the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .

too much power  not enough puff . 
despite some strong performances  never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic  and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history  it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
a deep and meaningful film . 
that the chuck norris  grenade gag  occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
the movie  despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places  is wry and engrossing . 
by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk  . . . actually pretty good . of course  by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
a so-so  made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
 . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm  the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick  bartleby performs neither one very well . 
a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
easier to respect than enthuse over  andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . 
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society  but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety  not to mention a convincing brogue .

chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism  and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible  almost mystical work . 
a creepy  intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
george  hire a real director and good writers for the next installment  please . 
not everything in the film works  including its somewhat convenient ending .

the music makes a nice album  the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
[davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany  yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
exciting documentary .

a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done  except maybe for the last 15 minutes  which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for  though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
i liked the movie  but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg  who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks  lawrence desperately looks elsewhere  seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
this is a superior horror flick . 
the direction  by george hickenlooper  has no snap to it  no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .

a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
it's endlessly inventive  consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short  tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
horrible
the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
dogtown is hollow  self-indulgent  and - worst of all - boring . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics )  much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple  deeply satisfying . 
whatever one makes of its political edge  this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema's master craftsmen . 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .

wonder  hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along  especially if it begins with the name of star wars
it's a long way from orwell's dark  intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium  and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who  in spite of all that he's witnessed  remains surprisingly idealistic  and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families  but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
a bit too eager to please . 
a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds  with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
the latest installment in the pokemon canon  pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two  likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots  just dots . 
stale and clich�d to a fault . 
reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing  however  is the edge of wild  lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
the result is more depressing than liberating  but it's never boring . 
lavishly  exhilaratingly tasteless . 
the results  if not memorable  are at least interesting . 
this movie is so bad  that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
in the not-too-distant future  movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now  they're merely signposts marking the slow  lingering death of imagination . 
the story  like life  refuses to be simple  and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
there is no solace here  no entertainment value  merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
at times  the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares  on the other hand  will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies  newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying  in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia  is quite beautiful . 
john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
warm and exotic . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages  apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
for a story set at sea  ghost ship is pretty landbound  with its leaden acting  dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
it all unfolds predictably  and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time  providing no real sense of suspense . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
 . . . flat-out amusing  sometimes endearing and often fabulous  with a solid cast  noteworthy characters  delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
simple  poignant and leavened with humor  it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
for the most part  it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
i liked this film a lot . . . 
even in the summertime  the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
makes s&m seem very romantic  and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
never comes together as a coherent whole . 
blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games  wire fu  horror movies  mystery  james bond  wrestling  sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become  the punk kids' revolution .  
cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
too much of the humor falls flat . 
an entertaining  colorful  action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clich�d  doddering  misogynistic boy's club . 
hardly a film that comes along every day . 
it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work  and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo  for all its effective moments  isn't really one of resources . 
un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
i couldn't recommend this film more . 
this big screen caper has a good bark  far from being a bow-wow . 
a fast  funny  highly enjoyable movie . 
a beautiful  timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy  betrayal  forgiveness and murder . 
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
for all the time we spend with these people  we never really get inside of them . 
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid  we get an ugly  mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
this version's no classic like its predecessor  but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
  the dangerous lives of altar boys  has flaws  but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast  are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books  they can't go wrong . better effects  better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 
interminably bleak  to say nothing of boring . 
  freaky friday   it's not . 
a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters  and actors . 
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip  young adult entertainment . 
seriously  rent the disney version . 
it's exactly what you'd expect . 
a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling  a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
massoud's story is an epic  but also a tragedy  the record of a tenacious  humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words  about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir  but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning  beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
what we have here isn't a disaster  exactly  but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has  and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin  inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses � and ours � and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash  and send it to its proper home . 
this is really just another genre picture . 
it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears  to be a girl in a world of boys  to be a boy truly in love with a girl  and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
[moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface  at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
a pretty funny movie  with most of the humor coming  as before  from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
like a precious and finely cut diamond  magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
it does give a taste of the burning man ethos  an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
human nature is a goofball movie  in the way that malkovich was  but it tries too hard . 
an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy  but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed  but that's neither completely enlightening  nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully  this remains a film about something  one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
this picture is murder by numbers  and as easy to be bored by as your abc's  despite a few whopping shootouts . 
green ruins every single scene he's in  and the film  while it's not completely wreaked  is seriously compromised by that . 
the master of disguise is funny--not  ha ha  funny   dead circus performer  funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
[a] slummer . 
call it magic realism or surrealism  but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast  actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
 . . . an airless  prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
it is a likable story  told with competence . 
an ambitiously naturalistic  albeit half-baked  drama about an abused  inner-city autistic teen . 
i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
try as i may  i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie  even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted  'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
as a revenge thriller  the movie is serviceable  but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
once again  director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
smothered by its own solemnity . 
thankfully  the film  which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland  basically . 
an enthralling  entertaining feature . 
a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed  manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
old-form moviemaking at its best . 
witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image  but it's dench who really steals the show . 
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center  no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent  but spacey's . 
not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe  but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
  its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right .  
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
the hours  a delicately crafted film  is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .
